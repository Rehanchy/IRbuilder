### A program to generate LLVM-IR file from .sy(same as.c)

My Contributions are 

- `./simple`

- base on provided API, I developed new API for generating multi-dimension array

  The main program is
  
  `./IRbuilder/src/SysYFIRBuilder/IRBuilder.cpp`
  
  However I have also modified files in
  
  `./IRbuilder/include/SysYFIR`

 	 `./IRbuilder/src/SysYFIR`

â€‹		to build the API we use.
